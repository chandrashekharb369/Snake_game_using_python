## Game Flow

### Menu Navigation
1. Main Menu → Theme Selection / High Scores / Start Game
2. Theme Selection → Choose theme or enable Mix Mode
3. High Scores → View leaderboards per theme
4. Game Over → Statistics + Play Again / Main Menu

### Gameplay Loop
1. Snake moves continuously in current direction
2. Player input changes direction (no reverse allowed)
3. Food collision → Score increase + snake growth
4. Bonus food spawns every 10 regular foods
5. Speed increases every 50 points
6. Obstacles spawn starting at 200 points
7. Game ends on collision → Save score → Game Over screen

### Difficulty Progression
- **Level 0-1**: Basic gameplay, no obstacles
- **Level 2+**: Obstacles begin spawning
- **Level 5+**: Significant speed increase
- **Level 10+**: Maximum challenge

## Controls Reference

### Menu Controls
- **Mouse**: Click buttons to navigate
